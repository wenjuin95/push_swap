# PUSH SWAP
this project is to learn about sorting algorithms.

## the project sorting a stack of integer using a set of operation such as:

- sa (swap a): swap first 2 element at the top of "stack a"
- sb (swap b): swap first 2 element at the top of "stack b"
- ss : [sa] and [sb] at the same time
  
<img src="https://github.com/wenjuin95/push_swap/blob/main/img/image%20(1).jpg" width="340" height="220" />

- pa (push to a) : take the first element on top of "stack b" and push to "stack a"
- pb (push to b) :  take the first element on top of "stack a" and push to "stack b"
  
<img src="https://github.com/wenjuin95/push_swap/blob/main/img/image%20(2).jpg" width="340" height="220" />  

- ra (rotata a) : the first element become last element in "stack a"
- rb (rotate b) : the first element become last element in "stack b"
- rr : [ra] and [rb] at the same time

<img src="https://github.com/wenjuin95/push_swap/blob/main/img/image%20(3).jpg" width="340" height="220" />  

- rra (reverse rotate a) : the last element become first element in "stack a"
- rrb (reverse rotate b) : the last element become first element in "stack b"
- rrr : [rra] and [rrb] at the same time
