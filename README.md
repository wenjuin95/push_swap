# PUSH SWAP
1. this project is to learn about sorting algorithms.
2. the project sorting a stack of integer using a set of operation such as:
- sa (swap a): swap first 2 element at the top of "stack a"
- sb (swap b): swap first 2 element at the top of "stack b"
- ss : [sa] and [sb] at the same time
- pa (push to a) : take the first element on top of "stack b" and push to "stack a"
- pb (push to b) :  take the first element on top of "stack a" and push to "stack b"
- ra (rotata a) : the first element become last element in "stack a"
- rb (rotate b) : the first element become last element in "stack b"
- rr : [ra] and [rb] at the same time
- rra (reverse rotate a) : the last element become first element in "stack a"
- rrb (reverse rotate b) : the last element become first element in "stack b"
- rrr : [rra] and [rrb] at the same time
